Round Robin Bus Arbiter

Project Overview

This project implements a 4-request Round Robin Bus Arbiter using Verilog HDL. The arbiter manages multiple request signals and grants access to one requester at a time using a rotating priority mechanism.

Unlike fixed-priority arbitration, Round Robin arbitration provides fair access by changing the priority after each successful grant.

Design Specifications

- Number of requesters: 4
- Request signals: "req[3:0]"
- Grant signals: "grant[3:0]"
- Clock: Positive-edge triggered
- Reset: Asynchronous active-high
- Arbitration: Round Robin priority-based selection
- Priority pointer: 2-bit register

Working Principle

The arbiter maintains a priority pointer that determines which requester receives the highest priority.

After a successful grant, the priority pointer advances to the next requester. This ensures that no requester continuously dominates the arbitration process when multiple requests remain active.

Verification and Testing

The testbench includes:

1. Clock generation and reset initialization.
2. Directed request testing.
3. Multiple simultaneous request testing.
4. Randomized request testing.
5. Mutual exclusion checking.
6. Invalid grant checking.
7. Fairness verification.
